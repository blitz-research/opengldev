Welcome to Mark's c++ opengl tutorials, for coders who are interested in
learning a little low level opengl dev in c++. I have no idea what direction
all this will take, but hopefully someone will find it useful.

I am developing this on my shiny new Raspberry Pi 400, but it should work fine
on any platform.

Quick start guide:

1) Install QtCreator from your package manager or from the Qt Website.

2) Install the 'glfw' library, again from your package manager or from a 
third party website (or build it!). This nifty little library makes writing
simple opengl apps much less of a nightmare than it would otherwise be.

3) Clone this repository to your local machine.

That should be it. You should be able to open then 'CMakeLists.txt' from the
cloned repositiory in QtCreator and be able to build and run it!

Note you don't actually *need* QtCreator to build the project, but installing
it is an easy way to install the development dependancies you will need.
But I do like QtCreator as an IDE even for non-Qt projects like this, and I
recommend giving it a shot if you haven't yet.
